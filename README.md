# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classification

This project applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images
into Normal and Pneumonia categories.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

## Method
- Image preprocessing: grayscale, resize to 150x150
- CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers

## Result
The model demonstrates good performance in pneumonia classification.
