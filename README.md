# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classification (CNN)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images
into Normal and Pneumonia categories.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

## Method
- Chest X-ray image preprocessing (grayscale, resize 150x150)
- CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers

## Result
The CNN model demonstrates good performance for pneumonia image classification.
